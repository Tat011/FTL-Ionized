Unfinished, may crash and the new weapons don't have unique sprites yet.
Requires Hyperspace, should still work without AE but no guarantees.
FTL Ionized is a balance/expansion mod that aims to increase the variety of runs with the following:
-Weapon balance/specialization: all weapons should have a niche to fill/reason to be used and no weapon should be able to do it all, so weapons have been balanced with this aim and you'll find that bad weapons have been buffed, busted weapons nerfed and some weapons been reworked to improve game feel/prevent weapon overlap.
-More weapons: self explanatory.
-Player Ship balance/specialization: Ships have been rebalanced so the very strong ships are weaker and the weak ships are stronger, some ships have been tweaked so you actually have to engage with their gimmick and a very small number of them have been reworked. This should make ships all equally viable and more distinct to play.
-Enemy ship specialization: have you noticed that most ships feel the same to fight? Well now faction ships are more distinct from other faction ships, they have more different  augments and revolve around different system preferences.
-More enemy ships: all ship layouts have been replaced.
-Augments have been tweaked a little but since their effects are hardcoded they're mostly the same.
-Drone balance: drones have been generally buffed.
-System balance: system upgrade costs have been tweaked, and some systems can be upgraded further than normal. I'd change more but it's also all hardcoded.
-Crew balance: aliens have been rebalanced generally with the attempt to make them viable in more situations than just the one, they also all got 1 active ability (like Crystal) that they can use once per jump and has a short duration.
New crew: 2 new aliens
-Rarity: Rarity has been changed so more weapons/crew spawn in more places, also weapon rarity is dependent on power use, more power = rarer. Rarity also changes based on the sector you're on
-Event tweaks: more options.
-More events: more events.
-Event distribution rebalance: What events show up where has been tweaked, almost all events are non repeatable on a sector, empty beacons are restricted to 1 per sector.
-Music: Deep Space Deluxe has been added and music has been shuffled around a bit, generally expanding the available tracks each sector has. (Did you know some sectors Only have 2 tracks?)
